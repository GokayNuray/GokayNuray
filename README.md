Hi, I am Gökay Nuray and I am a 2nd year student at Bilkent University. I love coding and learning new things. I also believe that I can learn everything in a short amount of time and this usually leads me to bite off more than I can chew. This pretty much sums me up :)

## Areas I'm interested in
- Game Development 👾

  I never used a game engine (yet), I like to learn the basics and reinvent the wheel myself :p

  - Graphic programming(OpenGL) 🅾️🅿️🆖🇱
 
    I spent what felt like hundreds of hours just to get a basic understanding of OpenGL and now I am somewhat able to use OpenGL effectively to make 3D games. Trying to learn it was the most fun I ever had in programming and I recommend it to everyone who could use a challenge!

  - Multiplayer 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
 
    I made multiplayer using a TCP connection with a server hosted on a different computer. I kinda copied this design from Minecraft but it seemed like the logical thing to do...

  - Modding/botting 🤖🛠️
 
    I also made Minecraft plugins and mods. One of my mods have scripting support, which lets me write scripts using JS to automate playing the game. Of course I do not use it to gain unfair advantage on multiplayer servers :trollface:

- Web Development

  - Backend 🗄️ 🍃(pretend that this looks like Java Spring logo)

    Backend development is very fun because Spring Boot already does everything for me so it is easy xD. I did not even write a single line of SQL code but I had a well functioning databse thanks to it!

  - Frontend 🅰️(for Angular)

    I really like frontend too because I see the thing I am doing INSTANTLY which makes me happy. Though I do not really enjoy spending an hour failing to stylize a component only for Github copilot chat to do it perfectly with a single prompt... 

- Android Development 📱

  For some reason I really like android. I am in a love-hate relationship with Android Studio since its emulator is very buggy and consumes ALL of my system resources even after I upgraded my RAM but it is very useful with many cool features. Android's heavy limitations and weird behaviors also draw me to itself for some reason. Finally, it uses Kotlin which is my favorite language so it is cool.

## My coding experiences
- Tübitak Bilgem Internship 🧑‍💼

  I worked on a website as a full stack developer. I learned and used Java Spring Boot and PostgreSQL for the backend, and Angular(with HTML, CSS, TS) for the frontend. I also experienced how working on a half-completed feels like (it was horrible). But learning so many new things and the workplace was really enjoyable.

- [Across the Sands of Time](https://github.com/GokayNuray/Across-the-Sands-of-Time) ⏳

  This was my CS 102 project with 4 other people. We made a 3D multiplayer FPS game(and a 2D combat game(idk what it really means) which I always forget about). We used OpenGL and the multiplayer design I explained above in this game. It was very time consuming and hard but the final product was great. We completed an almost working version of it 5 minutes before presenting it and completed the final product 1 hour after the deadline xD. I got an A+ grade in CS102 possibly because of it so my efforts were definitely worth it. I also kinda experienced working with a team and it was... nice I guess?

- [Gamin](https://github.com/GokayNuray/Gamin) :shipit:

  This was.. definitely something. I learned everything I know about Java, Android, and most of the OpenGL while working on this. I also learned multiplayer and interacting with servers stuff too.
