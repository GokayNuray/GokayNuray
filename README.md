## My coding experiences
- Tübitak Bilgem Internship 🧑‍💼

  I worked on a web application as a full stack developer. I learned and used Java Spring Boot and PostgreSQL for the backend, and Angular(with HTML, CSS, TS) for the frontend. I experienced a real work environment for the first time and how working on a half-completed project feels like so it was very educational.

- [shop.gokaynu.com](https://github.com/GokayNuray/GokaynuShop) 🛒

  This is a mock e-shopping web application I made to learn how to use React. I also used TailwindCSS for the frontend, cloud computing services(Supabase API hidden behind a Cloudflare worker) for backend and Vercel for hosting. This may be my first project that can qualify as completed.

- [Across the Sands of Time](https://github.com/GokayNuray/Across-the-Sands-of-Time) ⏳

  This was my CS 102 project with 4 other people. We made a 3D multiplayer FPS game(and a 2D combat game). We used OpenGL for rendering and a server hosted on Google Cloud in this game. This was my first time working with a team and I learned many valuable lessons...
